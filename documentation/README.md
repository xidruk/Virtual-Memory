# Virtual Memory Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation about virtual memory implementations across different operating systems and general theoretical concepts. Virtual memory is a fundamental component of modern operating systems that provides an abstraction between the memory addresses used by a program and the physical memory addresses in computer hardware.

## Directory Structure

- **[linux/](./linux/)** - Documentation on Linux virtual memory implementation
- **[windows/](./windows/)** - Documentation on Windows virtual memory implementation
- **[general-concepts/](./general-concepts/)** - Generic virtual memory concepts applicable across operating systems

## Linux Virtual Memory

The Linux directory contains documentation about the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem, including:

- Buddy allocator system
- Memory zones and NUMA support
- Page tables and TLB management
- Kernel memory allocation (SLAB/SLUB)
- Swap space management
- Memory cgroups and resource control

For detailed information, see the [Linux README](./linux/README.md).

## Windows Virtual Memory

The Windows directory contains documentation about Windows memory manager, covering:

- Windows memory architecture
- Page file management
- Virtual Address Descriptors (VAD)
- Working Set management
- Memory protection mechanisms
- .NET memory management

For detailed information, see the [Windows README](./windows/README.md).

## General Virtual Memory Concepts

The general-concepts directory covers fundamental principles of virtual memory that apply across operating systems:

- Address translation mechanisms
- Page tables and TLBs
- Memory protection
- Memory hierarchies
- Paging algorithms
- GPU memory management

For detailed information, see the [General Concepts README](./general-concepts/README.md).

## Key Learning Topics

### Memory Addressing
Understanding how programs reference memory and how these references are translated into physical addresses.

### Memory Protection
How operating systems isolate processes from each other and prevent unauthorized memory access.

### Paging Systems
Implementation of page tables, page replacement algorithms, and demand paging.

### Physical Memory Management
Allocation strategies, fragmentation concerns, and memory pools.

### Virtual Memory Performance
Optimizing virtual memory systems for performance, including reducing page faults and improving TLB hit rates.

## Using This Documentation

This repository is organized to facilitate learning about virtual memory from multiple perspectives:

1. **By Operating System** - Explore specific implementations in Linux or Windows
2. **By Concept** - Understand theoretical components that apply across systems
3. **Progressive Learning** - Start with general concepts before diving into OS-specific details

Each subdirectory contains its own README with detailed information about the included PDF documents and links to additional resources.
