# Linux Virtual Memory System

## Overview

This directory contains documentation related to the Linux virtual memory implementation. Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an abstraction between memory as seen by a process and physical memory, allowing for efficient memory usage, memory protection, and the illusion of contiguous memory spaces.

## Contents

This section includes the following PDF documents:

- **linux-vm-overview.pdf**: General overview of Linux virtual memory system
- **linux-page-tables.pdf**: Detailed explanation of Linux page table implementation
- **linux-memory-management.pdf**: Comprehensive guide to memory management in Linux kernel

## Key Linux Virtual Memory Concepts

### The Linux Memory Architecture

Linux divides the virtual address space into two parts:
- **Kernel Space**: Upper portion reserved for kernel operations (typically above 0xC0000000 in 32-bit systems)
- **User Space**: Lower portion available to user processes

### Page Tables in Linux

Linux uses a multi-level page table structure:
- For 32-bit systems: Typically 2-level page tables
- For 64-bit systems: 4-level or 5-level page tables (depending on kernel version)

### Memory Zones

Linux organizes physical memory into zones:
- **ZONE_DMA**: Used for DMA-capable devices with addressing limitations
- **ZONE_NORMAL**: Regular memory
- **ZONE_HIGHMEM**: Memory not directly mapped in kernel space (32-bit systems)

### Key Memory Management Components

- **Buddy Allocator**: Manages physical page frames
- **SLAB/SLUB/SLOB Allocators**: Kernel memory allocators for smaller objects
- **Page Cache**: Caches pages from disk for improved I/O performance
- **Memory Reclamation**: kswapd daemon and related mechanisms

## Related Kernel Source Files

Key files to explore in the Linux kernel source:
- `mm/memory.c`: Core memory management code
- `arch/*/mm/`: Architecture-specific memory management
- `include/linux/mm.h`: Memory management definitions

## Further Reading

For deeper understanding, review the following:
- Linux kernel documentation in the `Documentation/vm/` directory
- Mel Gorman's "Understanding the Linux Virtual Memory Manager"
- Robert Love's "Linux Kernel Development"

## Notes

When studying these documents, pay special attention to the interaction between:
- Virtual memory subsystem
- Process management
- File system caching
- Memory mapped files
