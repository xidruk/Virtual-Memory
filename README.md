## What is Virtual Memory?

Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an abstraction between memory as seen by applications and physical memory hardware. It enables:

- Programs to use more memory than physically available
- Memory protection between processes
- Efficient memory sharing when appropriate
- Simplified memory allocation for applications

## Key Topics Covered

### OS-Specific Implementations

- **Linux Memory Management**
  - Buddy allocator system
  - Memory zones and NUMA architecture
  - Kernel memory allocators (SLAB/SLUB)
  - Page cache and dirty page handling

- **Windows Memory Management**
  - Page file configuration and management
  - Working set algorithms
  - Memory protection mechanisms
  - Pool memory (paged and non-paged)

### Core Concepts

- Address translation and page tables
- TLB operation and optimization
- Page replacement algorithms
- Memory protection mechanisms
- Segmentation vs. paging
- GPU virtual memory management

## Getting Started

1. Begin with the [general concepts documentation](./documentation/general-concepts/README.md) to understand fundamental principles
2. Explore OS-specific implementations in [Linux](./documentation/linux/README.md) or [Windows](./documentation/windows/README.md)
3. Review the summaries for comparisons between different approaches
4. Check the resources section for additional learning materials
